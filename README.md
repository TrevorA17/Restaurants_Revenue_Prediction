# Restaurants Revenue Prediction
This project aims to predict monthly revenue for restaurants using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various features such as the number of customers, menu price, marketing spend, cuisine type, average customer spending, promotions, and reviews. We employed several machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to model the relationship between these features and the monthly revenue. The best performing model was selected based on cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE. The chosen model, a Linear Regression model, was then saved and deployed as a RESTful API using the Plumber package in R, allowing users to make real-time predictions on new data. This README provides an overview of the project structure, data preprocessing steps, model training process, and instructions for accessing the deployed API endpoint. Feel free to explore the code and reproduce the results for your own restaurant revenue prediction tasks.
